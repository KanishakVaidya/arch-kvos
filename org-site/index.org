KVOS is based on vanilla arch linux. This is a lightweight and fast desktop. It is light on system resources and [[./software.org][didn't install many packages]] by default.

** Lightweigth
Lightweigth linux distro. Small memory and storage overhead. Even the processors are at ease.
** Arch BTW!
Just some i3 config filed on top of vanilla arch. And one extra repository to get you some beautiful wallpapers.
** Productive
Tiling window managers are objectively better than floating window managers. And manual better than dynamic.
** Customizable
Customising KVOS is extremely easy. All custumization is done inside config files. That too inside emacs org mode.
** Free(eeedom)
Ofcourse its free but specifically its libre. You can use, change, improve, make it worse, burn, destroy, send to moon, sell any copy of this software.
** Donate
If you manage to sell KVOS and want to give me my share (40-60 is fine) OR if you want to donate to me anyway, please send money to [[img:upi.jpg][this UPI address.]]
