* KVOS
This is my custom i3wm based desktop. This is tested on an vanilla arch install. This is a lightweight and fast desktop. It is light on system resources and [[./software.org][didn't install many packages]].

** Lightweigth
*** Very lightweight distro. Low memory and storage overhead.
** Arch based
*** Just some i3 config filed on top of vanilla arch. And one extra repository.
** Made for productivity
*** Tiling window managers are objectively better than floating window manager. If you disagree, I will find youm and I will kick ur Ass.
